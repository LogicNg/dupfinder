# Dupfinder

## What's That

It basically does several things

1. Run through all of your photos
2. Find similar ones
3. Pick the best ones
4. Put them into a new folder called `filtered`

## Getting Started

Only Windows machines are supported currently!

### Folder Structure

Download `dupfinder_windows.zip` from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i7joGJe-WYZtMQDpSyqnVpoGn7reHkf8) and extract it. You should see

```
dupfinder/
  ├── _internal/
  ├── photos/
  └── main.exe
```

Place all your images inside the `photos` folder. Double click `main.exe` and it will do the magic. The selected images will get copied to the `filtered` folder. If you are running it for the first time, initialization will take a bit longer.
