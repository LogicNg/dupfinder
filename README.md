# Dupfinder

## Important Stuff

If you want to see the code, give me some time, I need to clean it up a bit.

I highly recommend you to star this project and follow me on GitHub so you get notified when I update the repo.

## What's That

It basically does several things

1. Run through all of your photos
2. Find similar ones
3. Pick the best ones
4. Put them into a new folder called `filtered`

## Getting Started

Only Windows machines are supported currently!

### Folder Structure

Download `dupfinder_windows.zip` from here and extract it. You should see

```
dupfinder/
  ├── _internal/
  ├── photos/
  └── main.exe
```

Place all your images inside the `photos` folder. Double click `main.exe` and it will do the magic. The selected images will get copied to the `filtered` folder. If you are running it for the first time, initialization will take a bit longer.

If you have any questions or need further assistance, text me on WhatsApp or Instagram!
